Army Memorandum LaTeX Class
============

![Sample Memo](example.png)

## Purpose
Provides a basic AR 25-50 memo in LaTeX. S1 approved!
## Requirements
- Requires XeLaTeX for font handling.
- Requires the Arial font to be installed, if it's not already.
### Ubuntu
To install the XeLaTeX, run the following commands:
```
sudo apt-get install texlive-xetex
```
To install the Arial font:
```
sudo apt-get install ttf-mscorefonts-installer
sudo fc-cache
```
### MacOS
The Arial font will already be installed, but you will need to install XeLaTeX [here](http://www.tug.org/mactex/index.html).
### Windows
I currently don't have a method of testing this on Windows.

## Installation and Usage
Within a terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/FourMoreCups/army-memorandum-class.git
cd army-memorandum
make
```
Bam! You'll find the file `example.pdf` in the directory.
To change the data, use your favorite text editor to edit `example.tex` and then run `make` again.
